This project is a terminal-based Chess Game implemented in C++ as part of a Programming Fundamentals (PF) course. It supports two-player mode, enforces core chess rules (piece movement, check/checkmate, board updates), and demonstrates object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
